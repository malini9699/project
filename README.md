Problem Statement :
              Given an image or video, develop a system that can identify and locate all instances of objects of specific classes.
This typically involves two key aspects:
Object Classification: 
             The system needs to correctly classify the object into a predefined category (e.g., car, person, dog).
Object Localization: 
             The system needs to draw a bounding box around each detected object, indicating its precise location within the image or video frame.
Description:
             Object detection is a computer vision task involving identifying and locating objects in images or video frames. It employs techniques toextract features,
localize objects with bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and classify them into predefined categories.
This enables machines to recognize objects of interest in visual data, facilitating applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and image understanding.
